# Interactive AI Podcast Platform

## Overview
VoxQuery is an open-source platform inspired by NotebookLM that transforms pre-recorded podcasts into interactive experiences. Users can participate in discussions by raising their hands to ask questions, receiving contextual responses powered by LLM models and brought to life through Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology.
